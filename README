TiddlyWebPlugins provides a virtual namespace for mature
TiddlyWeb plugins. It also provides tiddlywebplugins.utils,
a suite of tools that make creating and handling plugins
in TiddlyWeb a bit more sensible.

Essentially the utilities raise duplication to a common
core without encumbering the TiddlyWeb core.
